# Who am I?
Hi, I'm Nick, ${CurrentYear - 2002} years old C++ developer (kind of embedded, kind of fullstack).
After a year of study at *MIREA - RUSSIAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY* on a computer science course, I became disillusioned with a Russian higher school and began looking for a job as a developer.

# My experience
I started my career in a small company dealing with security systems and panels as Junior C++. 
Due to the legacy code, we had to use the borland C++11 standard (11 standard was not fully supported) and write a lot of bicycles. Not recommended ðŸ‘Ž.

However, I got a very valuable experience in production development and experience with preprocessor macros.

Soon I received an offer from an large fintech company. It was an offer not to be refused.
Great office, free schedule, coffee and cookies. And also C++17/20 with modern libraries *(grpc, proto, boost, gtest, rapidjson/nlohmann_json, spdlogger, etc...)*, experienced colleagues and well-established business processes.

Since then, I have managed to work with embedded devices(different parts of ATM, biometric devices), deal with different parts of C++ (multi-threading, metaprogramming, networking), have fun with cross-platform development(Windows/Linux/Mac), figured out a little in the front-end(single page application with typescript+react+mobx+eslint) and become a team leader of a small team.
