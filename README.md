# Who am I?
Hi, I'm Nick, 19 years old C++ developer.
After a year of study at *MIREA - RUSSIAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY* on a computer science course, I became disillusioned with a Russian higher school and began looking for a job as a developer.

# My developer experience
ðŸŒ± I started my career in a small company dealing with security systems and panels as Junior C++. 
Due to the legacy code, we had to use the borland C++11 standard (11 standard was not fully supported) and write a lot of bicycles. Not recommended ðŸ‘Ž.

However, I got a very valuable experience in production development and experience with preprocessor macros.

Soon I received an offer from an large company. It was an offer not to be refused:  
Great office, free schedule, coffee and cookies. And also C++17 with modern libraries *(boost, gtest, rapidjson/nlohmann_json, spdlogger, etc...)*, experienced colleagues and well-established business processes.

I've now been with the company for over half a year now and I feel experienced enough to try and contribute to the open source community.

***

ðŸ”­ Now I'm updating my old repositories, applying the skills I've learned over time.
